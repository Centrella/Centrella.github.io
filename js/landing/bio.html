					Centrella is a rising Hip Hop star from Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, an upcoming graduate from the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, and an inspiration in overcoming hardship. As a child, he lived with his drug addicted mother in deplorable conditions and domestic violence before finally being found in a motel by police at age 6. Centrella then spent his childhood bouncing through multiple foster homes, group homes, and institutions until aging out of the system at age 18.

					He began to pursue music in 2014 and has since released two mixtapes, Just Me & I Won’t Bow. He is currently independent and in the midst of a visual EP meant to tell his story and raise awareness about the issues with the foster care system. While the EP and video are not set to be released until summer of 2017, Centrella continues to release singles every month with the most recent being, “No Favors,” out since August 19, 2016
