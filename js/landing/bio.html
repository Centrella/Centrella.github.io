					Centrella is hip-hop artist from Wilkes Barre, PA. Inspired by his hardship growing up, his music full of personal details and emotion. Performing over dark trap-type beats “The rapper holds nothing back, giving us bangers while still being able to paint the pictures of his story.”<br /><br />Centrella is currently working on his second release: a concept mixtape titled I Won&rsquo;t Bow, which is set to release early February 2016 on all streaming services as well as music blogs that have covered his previous releases, such as MusicOnTheDot. Aside from making music he is currently in his third year at NYU&rsquo;s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, majoring as a creative entrepreneur.<br /><br />Growing up in foster care from age 6 because of his mother&rsquo;s heroine addiction, Centrella started rapping at 15 years old and began to pursue a career in music when he got accepted as a transfer student to NYU in 2014. As part of the program he studies, he is putting together a string of projects to be pitched and evaluated by the school&rsquo;s staff and working music industry professionals with the end goal of obtaining a recording contract. While his music focuses on his struggles coming up, it has a dark theme and is characterized by a rebellious attitude and sarcastic tone. The line from his new song “Take It How U Wanna” speaks the most: “mommy loved them needle drugs/ like Britney Spears shave ya fuckin head, you need a buzz/ so rap became my outlet, what does that make me the plug?/ when I come around she feinin ‘cus I&rsquo;m so dope.”<br /><br />So far he has released one tape, Just Me, and plans to release 3 more in 2016 as well as several music videos. I Won&rsquo;t Bow is anticipated to be released in February alongside videos for multiple songs including one re-release “When The Bell Tolls.” The latter is a dark, aggressive and unforgiving letter to his mother. Centrella currently motivationally speaks at foster youth groups and continues to use his personal story in his music throughout his career.
