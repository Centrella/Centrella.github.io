					Centrella is a hip-hop artist out of Wilkes Barre, PA. Coming from a family involved in drugs and crime, Centrella was put into foster care at a young age. Inspired by his hardship growing up, his music is full of personal details through a bold, aggressive and emotional account of his life. Centrella mainly works with darker, bass-heavy and expirimental production; “The rapper holds nothing back, giving us bangers while still being able to paint the pictures of his story,” writes Music on the Dot. Centrella aims to confront the issues involved in growing up in the foster care system and to inspire more foster children to success. He currently has two projects out, Just Me and I Won’t Bow, which can be found on Spotify, Apple Music/iTunes, Tidal, Soundcloud and YouTube. Aside from making music he is currently in his third year at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, majoring as a creative entrepreneur.<br /><br />Having never known his father and with his mother being addicted to heroine, Centrella grew up in foster care from age 6. After being found living in a motel he was taken into custody where he bounced through foster homes, group homes and institutions for 12 years. Centrella started rapping at 15 years old prior to being placed in a mental hospital when his foster parents started reading his lyrics. After graduating high-school, first generation, he began to seriously pursue a career in music; Centrella discovered the Clive Davis Institute and worked his way in by starting at a lower tier college and transferring over. He got accepted as a transfer student to NYU in 2014. As part of the program he studies, he is putting together a business plan that involves multimedia projects which focus on his music and how it relates to his upbringing in the foster care system. Centrella is fearless and brutally honest in the way that he approaches speaking on his struggles in music. The line from his new song “Take It How U Wanna” speaks the most: “Mommy loved them needle drugs/ like Britney Spears shave ya fuckin head, you need a buzz/ so rap became my outlet, what does that make me the plug?/ when I come around she feinin ‘cus I’m so dope.”<br /><br />I Won’t Bow has just been released February 22, 2016 and was followed by a music video for his single “Fuckin Stressd” on March 14, 2016. The single is an intense and emotional song in which Centrella vents his frustrations; in the video, Centrella can be seen acting out his rage as he trashes an apartment and takes his anger out on others. In addition to his current project, Centrella also motivationally speaks at foster youth groups and continues to use his personal story in his music throughout his career.
